### Hello there! To be short, I would like to describe the project in two words.

This project represents an interactive and hyperlinked rulebook for a card game. As a source, it takes [these rules](https://media.wizards.com/2021/downloads/MagicCompRules%2020210419.txt 'Magic: The Gathering rules'). Then the actual magic happens, and this rulebook is being presented to the user in an interactive form. Voila!

### Here comes a bit more technically descriptive part.

---

### To start:

-   Create .env file, where you put this string:

```
REACT_APP_BE_URL=*Link to your cors-anywhere server*
```

Remember, that your link should end with dash char (/)

-   npm start

### VCS

I am using Git Flow for organizing branches and VCS, and Standard Version for making changes to CHANGELOG.md and versions
